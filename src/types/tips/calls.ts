     * - `hash`: The identity of the open tip for which a tip value is declared. This is formed
     *   as the hash of the tuple of the hash of the original tip `reason` and the beneficiary
     *   account ID.
     * - `tip_value`: The amount of tip that the sender would like to give. The median tip
     *   value of active tippers will be given to the `who`.
     * 
     * Emits `TipClosing` if the threshold of tippers has been reached and the countdown period
     * has started.

     * - Complexity: `O(T)` where `T` is the number of tippers. decoding `Tipper` vec of length
     *   `T`, insert tip and check closing, `T` is charged as upper bound given by
     *   `ContainsLengthBound`. The actual cost depends on the implementation of `T::Tippers`.
     * 
     *   Actually weight could be lower as it depends on how many tips are in `OpenTip` but it
     *   is weighted as if almost full i.e of length `T-1`.
